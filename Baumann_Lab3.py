"""
#1. Here I am importing the math library so that I can use the Square Root /
# function within the library. Then I created a variable num and set it / 
# equivalent to the square root of 144 using the math.sqrt command. I then /
# printed the statement with a string statement and the variable that i created/
# eariler using a comma to separate them.
import math
num= math.sqrt(144)
print('The square root of 144 is', num)

#2.

b= 9.3 
c2= (a*a)+(b*b)
